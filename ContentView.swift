        PM stands for particulate matter, which is the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. In particular, PM2.5 particles, also known as fine inhalable particles with diameters that are around 2.5 micrometers and smaller, are generally emitted from construction sites, unpaved roads, smokestacks or fires. These particles pose serious risk to health, thus, it is vital to monitor the level of PM2.5 regularly.
        PM2.5 Air Quality Index:
        0-50    Good
        51-100  Moderate
        101-150 Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
        151-200 Extremely Unhealthy
    """
    var resultMessage = """
    The air quality is typically directly defined by the CO2 and PM2.5 levels (for more details, please refer to their definitions by clicking them above), whereas the temperature and the relative humidity can give you an idea of the surrounding environment in terms of how you feel physically.
    """
    var tempMessage = """
    The measure of hotness or coldness expressed in terms of any of several arbitrary scales and indicating the direction in which heat energy will spontaneously flowâ€”i.e., from a hotter body (one at a higher temperature) to a colder body (one at a lower temperature).
    """
    var co2Message = """
    The measure of the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This is measured in units of parts per million (ppm), which tells the average number of CO2 molecules out of one million air molecules.
    250-400 ppm: Normal outdoor air level.
    400-1,000 ppm: Typical level found in occupied spaces with good air exchange.
    1,000-2,000 ppm: Level associated with complaints of drowsiness and poor air.
    2,000-5,000 ppm: Level associated with headaches, sleepiness, and stagnant, stale, stuffy air. Poor concentration, loss of attention, increased heart rate and slight nausea may also be present.
    > 5,000 ppm: Toxicity or oxygen deprivation could occur. This is the permissible exposure limit for daily workplace exposures.
    > 40,000 ppm: This level is immediately harmful due to oxygen deprivation.
    """
    var humidityMessage = """
    Relative humidity is the amount of water vapor (vapor pressure) that is in the air. It is a percentage of how much moisture the air could possibly hold. The amount of vapor that can be contained in the air increases with temperature. The higher the percentage of relative humidity, the more humid (moist) the air feels, while a lower percentage usually feels drier.
    Typically people find a relative humidity of 30% - 60% most comfortable. Anything higher than 60% is considered high humidity level, and it provides an environment for two common asthma and allergy triggers: dust mites and mould. Anything lower than 30% is considered low humidity level, and it increases the chance of catching airborne viruses like a cold or the flu. Also, very dry air can make eczema worse and dry skin can be uncomfortable.
